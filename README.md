## About The Project
![banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adhilsalim/LabDrive/main/readme_banner.jpeg)

Hi there üëã
LabDrive is a simple web platform to host and manage program files.
This project is still in the development stage and no releases have been made as of December 2022.

This web platform can be used in computer science/IT labs for students to save their programs. Saved programs can be accessed anywhere on any device. The faculties/teachers can control when the download option shall be enabled, to prevent downloading programs during lab hours. As an experimental feature, roll number-based authentication is used for ease of login. 

The project is built with vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap and for authentication, database and cloud storage firebase is used.

This web platform is expected to offer the following features:
1. Creating, Modifying folders
2. Creating, Modifying, Editing, Download, Uploading program files
